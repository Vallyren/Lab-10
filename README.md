### Objectives
#### Part 1: Basic Device Configuration
In this part of this lab, you set up the network topology and configure basic settings, such as the interface IP addresses, static routing, device access, and passwords.
Note: All tasks should be performed on routers R1, R2, and R3. The procedures are shown for only one of the routers.
##### Step 1: Cable the network as shown in the topology.
